    Pick one consolidated entry/stop/target for the setup: prefer a
    structural (pattern-based) level over a generic ATR one, since it's
    tied to actual chart geometry rather than a fixed multiple. The target
    is then replaced with the detector's real historical average move when
    that data is available (see calibrate_target) - the reported scenario
    reflects what has actually happened, not just what the geometry implies.

    Structural stop/target come from independent pieces of geometry though
    (e.g. a flag's stop is the whole consolidation range, its target is
    just the pole height) - nothing guarantees those two distances produce
    a favorable ratio. A candidate is only used if its reward:risk (using
    the calibrated target where available) clears min_risk_reward; if
    nothing does, this returns None rather than presenting a plan that
    risks more than it can gain. Among qualifying candidates, prefer the
    tightest (most disciplined) stop distance.

    `unreliable` is a set of (detector_name, direction) pairs to refuse
    outright, regardless of stop tightness or backtested edge - these are
    detectors the live journal has already shown to lose money at this
    stop/target sizing (see journal.detector_reliability). Without this,
    plan selection picks purely on which candidate's stop happens to be
    numerically tightest, which has nothing to do with whether that
    detector has ever actually worked.

    `market_disagrees` is whether BTC's and ETH's own current trend
    DISAGREES with `bias` - confirmed via a 2000+ trade backtest
    (confluence_btc_backtest.py) that every one of our proven detectors
    performs better - two of them flip from losing to winning - when an
    altcoin's setup goes AGAINST the market leaders rather than with them.
    A same-direction setup is more likely just beta (the whole market
    moving together) diluting the pattern's own signal, not genuine
    independent structure in that specific coin. Candidates in
    MARKET_FILTER_NAMES (the detectors this was actually tested on) are
    refused unless market_disagrees is True - None (BTC/ETH data
    unavailable) also refuses them, since the filter is unproven without it.

    `funding_ok` (default True, so callers that don't compute it aren't
    affected) is False when classify_funding says the trade is going
    AGAINST an extreme funding reading - the one funding_rate_backtest.py
    bucket that actually loses money. Unlike market_disagrees this
    defaults permissive, since most trades (neutral or with-the-crowd
    funding) are fine - only the specific proven-bad case is excluded.
