"""
Live signal journal - a forward-tested track record.

Backtests are retrospective and can be (even unintentionally) overfit to
the exact data they were tuned on. This journal logs every real setup the
scanner surfaces, then later checks what price actually did, building up
real forward performance over time - the only thing that actually proves
a system works going forward.

Storage: append-only JSONL (one JSON object per line) at journal.jsonl.
No database dependency, diff-friendly, trivial to append to from a
scheduled/cloud run.
